## Navy

### Best Ships for certain missions
- (Patrol) Cruisers || Destroyers (finding ships but not engaging)
- (Strike Force) Less Ships, Better; 2 Battleship, 8 Light Cruisers per Task Force 
  - **(DON'T USE)** Heavy Cruisers
- (Raiding Missions) 
  - Subs (1 Fleet pure subs) 10 - 20 subs per submarine
  - Avoid Shallow Seas
- (Escort Mission) Destroyers 8 per task force
- (Mine Laying) Subs for naval supremacy (not recommended for singleplayer)

Some compositions:   
1 - Carrier - 1 Battleship (Capital Ship) - 4 Screening ships

> Anything smaller than carrier and battleship is screening

1. Submarine Spam
	- Smaller countries without much navy.
	- Sub Type 3 (upgrade everything)
  
2. Meta 
   - Heavy Cruiser, Light Attack Cruiser with full light cruiser battery and 1 air craft
   - Destroyers, Light guns only (be fodder)
   - Destroyer, Best engine, torpedos

## Japan Tips
Some General tips:  
- 14/4 Infrantry
- CAS
- Tactical Bombers
- No Tanks
- Rush the Zero
- Destroyers to protect convoys
- Superior Firepower

Procedure: 
1. we start with "Purge the Kodoha Faction", grants +10% stability
2. Upon completion of that focus start "Guide theZaibatsus" which will buff your industry and add 2 civs.  
   
**STOP**: You're going to want to wait a few days beforepicking the next focus so you reach 150 PP at which thenyou can purchase the silent workhorse.

3. After waiting now you may select: "National MobilizationLaw" which changes your economy to war economy.
4. Select "National Research Policy" to receive and extraresearch spot.  
   
**STOP**: You're now going to wait to select "Nationalize WarIndustry" until you change your trade law to Free trade (soyou can trade with the axis 1 for 1).

5. Select "Nationalize War Industry" which gives 2 mils and2 civs.
6. Select "National Defense State": changes your economy tototal mob. Around this point you'll want to choose thedecision "Prioritize Steel for Guns" which gives you +4mils putting you at 26.

7. "Spiritual Mobilization" counteracts total mobconscription debuff. Also, you'll once again reach 150 ppand I recommend grabbing the military theorist for -10% research time on all land doctrines.  
   
In terms of PP, from now on out it's your decision. But forthe next few I recommend advisors that'll enhance yourability to fight China.

9. Liason Conference, you must now start heading on a pathto war with China.
10. Greater-East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere: makes yourfaction.
11.  Marco Polo Bridge Incident, prompts the China wardecisions.

## Additional Tips
* Synthetic Factories aren't worth building as long as you can buy oil and rubber since they are more expensive than civilian factories that can be used to buy more of those resources.
* Converting factories to the other type is almost never worth it.
* 20 Width is usually better than 40 width
* Sort  Navy don't just spam (unless subs)
* Mountaineer, other special units template similar to navy
* I prefer sticking such dedicated "garrison units" into ports by using s series of small â€œfallback lines". That makes sure that all of those places are well defended. AI would attempt to do that if you were to use a garrison order, but they sometimes fail. You would also need kore such divisions, since they also garrison major inland cities.
* Build Civs before 40 build mils after 40
* Build until you can construct avoid large queues
* 40 Width tanks always
